#This is the beginning of my AutoApply Application
# The purpose of this application is to gather information from a user. Have an ETL scrape a Job board for matching positions, and to have a resume retrieved from storage and sent to the job posting.
# Step one will be to identify a bot or method to collect the following information. (Name, email, password, keywords for job search
#The next step will be to develop an ETL that pulls the job information from the job board and runs a filter to remove duplicates and a refined search for keywords.
#The next step will be storing the information in a variable and writing a script to pull your resume from storage and email it to the variable.
